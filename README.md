I decided for a Bayesscher Spamfilter
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesscher_Spamfilter

The file"main.py" is my code with detailed description.

The file "test.py" is/was only to find best parameters for my classifier. This was done by using grid search, the best parameters where then used in the main-file.




to Run:

pdm install
pdm run main.py
