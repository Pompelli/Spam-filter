Steps to Complete the Spam Filter
Download Dataset:

Obtain spam and ham (non-spam) email examples from Apache SpamAssassin's public datasets. These datasets can be found at SpamAssassin's public corpus.
Data Preprocessing:

Unzip the dataset and familiarize yourself with its structure.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Feature Extraction:

Write a data preparation pipeline to convert each email into a feature vector.
Transform each email into a vector that records the presence (or absence) of each word.
Pipeline Options:

Include hyperparameters to adjust for different preprocessing options like:
Stripping headers
Converting text to lowercase
Removing punctuation
Replacing URLs and numbers
Stemming (using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy)
Classifier Selection:

Test various classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) to find a model with high recall and precision.
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and improve model performance.
Documentation and Report:

Document your code with comments, following PEP 8 standards.
Write a report in either an iPython notebook or LaTeX explaining your approach, decisions, and results.
Would you like help with code examples for any of these specific steps?
